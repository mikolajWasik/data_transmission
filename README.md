# Data transmission
# Description
In this repository, codes are stored that are solutions to tasks from a course on data transmission studies. In the first few tasks, various signals and their graphs versus time were generated. Then various, increasingly complex operations were carried out on these signals. Starting from the use of Fourier transforms to change the domain of a function from time to frequency, through the use of various types of modulation and demodulation, to the use of Hamming encoders and decoders to correct interference simulated by adding white noise to the actual signal.

# Generating signals
Signal 'x' is a basic signal. Then 'y' was generated based on 'x', 'z' based on 'y' and finally, 'v' based on 'z'.
